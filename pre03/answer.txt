Start in main method
Output:
**** No, I | <-- cursor left there
Jump to zoop method
  Jump to baffle method
    print wug *** No, I wug
      Jump to ping method
        println . *** No, I wug. (cursor on new line)
Back in zoop method, baffle done
On new line, print *** You wugga | <-- cursor left there
  Jump to baffle method again
    print wug *** You wugga wug| <-- cursor left there
      ping method
        print . *** You wugga wug.
Jump back to main method
  print I | <-- cursor left there
    Jump to baffle method
      print wug *** I wug| <-- cursor left there
        jump to ping method
          print . *** I wug.


Final output:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.


If baffle(); is added at the end of the ping() method,
an infinite loop will be created.
